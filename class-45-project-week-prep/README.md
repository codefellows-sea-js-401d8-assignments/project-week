# Class 45 - Project Week Prep Day
## Final Project Rules and Process

For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a web site that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

Here are some repos of past student projects that you may explore to get a sense of what past teams have produced:

* [Hue-Manatee githut] (https://github.com/hue-manatee/hue-manatee)
* [Job App heroku]  (http://dashjobs.herokuapp.com/#/signup)
* [Job App github] (https://github.com/DashJob)
* [Job Dash github api] (https://github.com/dmcfly85/dash-job-api)
* [Fit Cliques] (https://github.com/fit-cliques/fit_cliques)



### Rules:  

Your team must adhere to the following requirements.
* There can be no more than 4 people per team.
* Each person must make meaningful contributions in every language (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
* Your site/app must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation.
* Your site/app must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
* Your site/app state must persist between page reloads.
* Your site/app must be deployed live on the Internet.

### Process:

1. Your team must submit a proposal to the instructional staff by midday on the first day of Project Week.
2. Throughout project week, your team must work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
3. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.


By midday of the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor.  
You should be able to describe in your own words our project's pitch including the problem you are addressing and corresponding solution.  

**TIP:** Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch wireframes and data flows.
